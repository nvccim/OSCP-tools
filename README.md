# OSCP-tools
During my OSCP journey, I used a variety of tools to aid in my learning and preparation for the certification exam. These tools include popular penetration testing frameworks such as Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark, as well as custom scripts and utilities that I developed myself.

To further support the InfoSec community, I have decided to upload these tools to GitHub, a popular online repository for open-source software projects. By doing so, I hope to share my knowledge and contribute to the larger community of security researchers and enthusiasts.

Please note that while I have tested and used these tools during my OSCP journey, I make no guarantees regarding their performance or suitability for any specific use case. I encourage users to exercise caution and use these tools responsibly and legally, adhering to all applicable laws and regulations
